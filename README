Nagios Plugins :: nagios-plugins
================================

Introduction
------------

`nagios-plugins` is a collection of various plugins I have written and expaned
over the last ten years or so. They main goal of Nagios plugins that I write
and release are:

* BSD (or BSD like) license so you can hack away to wield into something that
  may be more suitable for your own environment;
* scalable in that if I am polling power supply units (PSUs) in a Cisco switch
  then it should not matter if there is one or a hundred - the script should
  handle them all;
* WARNINGs are designed for email notifications during working hours; CRITICAL
  means an out of hours text / SMS message :(
* Perl is not my first language but all scripts are written in Perl. Forgive
  my inelegence (and give me C / C++ / PHP anyday!)
* each script should be an independant unit with no dependancies on each
  other or unusual Perl modules;
* the scripts should all be run with the `--verbose` on new kit. This will
  provide an inventory of what it finds as well as show anything that is being
  skipped. OIDs searched for by the script but reported as not supported on
  the target device should really be skipped via various `--skip-xxx` options.
* useful help available via `--help` or `-?`
